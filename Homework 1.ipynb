    "A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone or ”export” out of the program you are writing.

You saw this many times with your use of print when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside \" or ' after the print to print the string.\n",
    "Strings can contain any number of variables that are in your Python script. Remember that a variable is any line of code where you set a name=(equal)toavalue. In the code forth is exercise, types_of_people = 10 creates a variable named types_of_people and sets it=(equal) to 10. You can put that in an y string with {types_of_people}. You also see that I have to use a special type of string to ”format”; it’s called an ”f-string” and looks like this: f”some stuff here { avariable}” f”some other stuff {anothervar}”\n"
